# Construction of Approximate Real Mutually Unbiased Bases for an infinite class of dimensions d â‰¢ 0 mod 4
This rproject provides a Python implementation to generate epsilon-Hadamard matrices from any Hadamard matrix whose order is a multiple of 4. It constructs epsilon-Hadamard matrices of order \(4n - t\) for \(t in \{1,2,3\}\), as described in the paper
## Overview
This python code takes Hadamard matrix of order 4n as input, and uses the methods in the paper to construct Îµ-Hadamard matrices of order 4n-t, where t belongs to {1,2,3}. For each Hadamard matrix, we get 2 Îµ-Hadamard matrices of a certain order, Y1 and Y2. Then this code checks that the produced matrices are indeed orthogonal. It calculates the Îµ value for the matrices, and the drift of the elements above and below +1 and -1. The lesser tha value of Îµ, the closer is this matrix to the Hadamard matrix, and the better the ARMUBs that can be generated from the methods referenced in the paper. We then save all these outputs to the respective file.
## Steps to run the project

### **1. Requirements**

- Python 3.x  
- numpy

Install dependencies (if not already installed):
pip install numpy

### Running the code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbc6c4c7-ceea-4634-9259-61637c600126)
Here you can choose t value to be 1, 2, or 3
Write the input file and output file path instead of the ones given.
Then run python main.py
The output file will include:
- Order and input Hadamard Matrix
- The 2 constructed Îµ-Hadamard matrices, Y1 and Y2
- Îµ values for the 2 Îµ-Hadamard matrices
- drift of elements of Îµ-Hadamard matrices above and below 1 and -1.
### Input Hadamard matrix file format
The input file will be in the standard Sloane database format, containing rows of + and -. + represents 1 and - represents -1 for the unnormalized Hadamard matrices. A collection of such files containing Hadamard matrices in almost every dimension where real Hadamard matrices exists can be found in this website: http://neilsloane.com/hadamard/. The sample files for reference are also from this website itself.

### File Structure
The files are labelled as such:
- main.py : python code to be run
- had.XXX.yyy.txt : input of Hadamard matrix or order XXX in the file format above
- output_XXX-t.txt : output of 	Îµ-Hadamard matrix of order XXX-t along with the Îµ value for the matrices, and the drift of the elements above and below +1 amd -1


## Output example
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4380893a-7e82-440e-8416-2ed2bb2c26e4)
The output output_XXX-t.txt will contain the following:
- The order of the hadamard matrix used, XXX
- The hadamard matrix of order XXX used
- The order of the Îµ-Hadamard matrix created
- The	2 Îµ-Hadamard matrix created
- The	Îµ values for the Îµ-Hadamard matrix created
- drift_above_1: difference of the largest element of the matrix and 1
- drift_below_1: difference of the smallest positive element of the matrix and 1
- drift_above_n1: difference of the largest negative element of the matrix and -1
- drift_below_n1: difference of the smallest element of the matrix and -1

**Remark**: The	Îµ values are calculated as in Definition 6 in the paper. The smallest value of each of the 4 drifts depicted are 0. Hence for example, if all elements are below 1, drift_above_1 will be 0. Similarly for the rest.
